# RemoveGilded

Inspired *very heavily* by [Noevain's removeTwisted](https://github.com/Noevain/removeTwisted) and [Moffein's EliteReworks](https://github.com/Moffein/EliteReworks) mods.
How this mod works is by updating gilded elites costs to be the same as normal tier 1 elites, and spawning a normal tier 1 elite whenever a gilded elite would otherwise spawn.
This mod likely won't be maintained actively as it was only made with the intent to just have more fun with a couple of friends.
So feel free to 'take inspiration' from this mod as I've done with the two aforementioned authors :)
